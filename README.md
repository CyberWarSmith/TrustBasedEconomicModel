# Trust Based Economic Model (TBEM)

TBEM explores trust as a first class economic primitive rather than an implicit social assumption.

This repository contains a conceptual whitepaper and an agent based simulation that examine whether economic systems built on verifiable trust, contribution, and accountability can produce stable cooperation while resisting manipulation.

## What this is

- A research driven conceptual model
- An agent based simulation implemented in NetLogo
- A framework for evaluating trust dynamics, externalities, and incentive alignment
- A platform for peer review and critique

## What this is not

- A cryptocurrency
- A token, coin, or financial product
- An investment proposal
- A claim of predictive economic forecasting

## Motivation

Modern economic systems rely heavily on trust while providing few mechanisms to measure, distribute, or revoke it. This creates conditions for moral hazard, hidden externalities, and extractive behavior.

TBEM investigates whether trust can be formalized, verified, and exchanged without relying on capital accumulation or centralized enforcement.

## Repository structure

- `whitepaper/`  
  The formal TBEM whitepaper, including theoretical foundations and simulation findings.

- `simulation/`  
  A NetLogo agent based model used to explore trust dynamics, Goodhart effects, Sybil resistance, and systemic stability.

- `figures/`  
  Visual outputs generated from simulation runs.

- `references/`  
  Bibliographic and citation management files.

## Status

This project is exploratory and under active development.  
The simulation evaluates architectural properties, not real world economic outcomes.

## How to engage

- Constructive critique is welcome via issues
- Pull requests should focus on clarity, correctness, or simulation robustness
- Ideological debate without reference to the model mechanics may be closed
